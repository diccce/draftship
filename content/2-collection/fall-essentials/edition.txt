A home should be a place of respite. That’s why this year’s Verge holiday gift guide offers a variety of items that you don't have to charge, check, update, or dock. Are there tech products on our list of home essentials? Naturally, because we think a virtual assistant or a tiny device that turns a dumb speaker into a smart speaker can make a home more comfortable and convenient. But we’re wagering that your friends and family will be equally thrilled by faux fur blankets, hand steamers, Nessie ladles, and chic Swedish raincoats.
