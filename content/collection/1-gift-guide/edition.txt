> Welcome to the very first edition of *Draftship*—a curated magazine for the modern gentleman and design enthusiast.

For this special time of the year, I handpicked in this edition a holiday gift guide full of ideas to help find the perfect present. The products may be seemingly simple, but consistently get it right—the clean form, the right materials, the detailed craftsmanship. Whether in use or in the background, they blend in to your space and leave subtle traces of your everyday life.
